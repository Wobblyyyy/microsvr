<b>Ultra-lightweight web server written in V.</b>
</p>

_microsvr_ is an incredibly lightweight and bare-bones web server spawned out
of my boredom during a physics lecture I don't want to pay attention to.

<h2>Configuration</h2>

A configuration file is required to use _microsvr_. This file must be named
`microsvrconfig.json` and must be in the same directory as the `microsvr`
executable. See the `microsvrconfig.json` file in this project for an example
on how to configure _microsvr_.
